# working_with_API

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to leverage both gmaps and OpenWeather APIs to create a desirable vacation itinerary based on temperature. The work involved the development of a random number generator for 2000 longitude and latitude coordinates. These coordinates were then used to determine nearby cities and their current weather patterns using the OpenWeather API. The gmaps API was used to depict mapping information about these locations and trip directions as well. The project was split into three stages that allowed for compartmentalizing of tasks: City aggregation, City filtering, and Directions application.

## Summary

The project showed created the following maps and based on the parameters set if between 75 and 90 maximum degrees farenheit, it would be reccomended to travel to Australia for a trip.
